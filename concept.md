## Concept
Image analysis based on RGB color can be applied to generating columnar section in geological study.  
Visual information composed of two-dimensional RGB color data, reflects morphological and physicochemical aspects of an object.  
Visual information is one of main factors that are employed to draw geological columnar section based on observing outcrops.
